                <b>Layout & Hierarchy:</b> The website displays two columns (on
                desktop view) that emulate the look of a book reflecting the
                purpose of the site. The inside of the two sections houses
                elegant display serif text. Using inspect element, the website
                uses flex to place the content on the website. Once the screen
                size gets too small a breakpoint splits the two column layout to
                a single column. Without this, the two-column layout would feel
                overcrowded on a smaller screen size.

                <b>Layout & Hierarchy:</b> The website uses a framework (not
                sure which one) to run the website. It is simple and works due
                to its streamlined aesthetic and content layout. The website has
                one column which has been optimised for small screen sizes. In a
                perfect demonstration of successful responsive web design, the
                display seamlessly transitions between screen sizes with only
                two breakpoints used.

                <b>Layout & Hierarchy:</b> The website layout consists of a
                three column design. The start of the page displays simple hero
                content which then goes into the main content of the page. A few
                responsive elements of the website are the work showreel, press
                and event sections of the website. Once the screen size gets too
                small the breakpoint elements collapse into a column layout.
                Flex is used to layout the content for the website.

            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>
              All three websites that I chose to analyse had minimal breakpoints
              but were still creative and complex with their layout and content.
              I believe this is the key to a well-made site. It doesn't need to
              be overly complicated with many breakpoints to be responsive and
              functional. While researching websites I noticed that they a lot
              of them had similar layouts with hero content as the main element
              then a cascading layout consisting of the main content.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>design choices</h4>
            <p>
              With the research in mind I chose to have a minimal layout
              consisting of a horizontal navbar, a hero image with text and box
              layout for my research (which could be news or other types of
              content). The responsive elements of the website are the navbar
              changing to a dropdown menu for small screen sizes and the main
              content changing from a three column layout to a single column
              layout.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>usability considerations</h4>
            <p>
              The website is minimal with a clear structure which remains
              responsive between different websites.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>challenges encountered</h4>
            <p>
              The challenges I faced included whether I should have used the
              flex or grid syntax to layout my website. The grid and flex syntax
              can help create a fluid responsive design system by organising
              content and allowing the site to become more streamlined. The grid
              syntax is better for vertical layout and flex is better for
              horizontal layout. I chose to go with a grid layout for the header
              and main content of the website because a grid layout is better
              for vertical content layout. Additionally I faced challenges with
              where to layout my content and the variable font not centring on
              the baseline properly (help Ben why is this happening?! If you
              highlight the text it doesn't align properly and it's annoying).
